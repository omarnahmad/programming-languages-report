			<h3>- Progamming Languages -</h3>
			<p style="color:#696969">A programing language is a set of keywords and syntaxes used for instructing computers or computing devices to perform certain task.
			<br>Nowadays, when people use the term programming language they are often referring to high-level programming languages such as c, c++,
			<br>java, and many other high-level languages.</p>
			<p style="color:#696969">Each programing language has its own unique set of keywords and a special syntax for organizing a program,
			<br>the process behind programing a program starts from high-level language pass through the assembler to be assembled and
			<br>finally stored in the memory.</p>

			<h3>- History of programming -</h3>
			<p style="color:#696969">Earlier, programs were written in machine language, where programmers write each instruction in a numeric form (binary) in which the hardware
			can execute directly. For example, the instruction to add a value in two memory locations might consist of 3 numbers: an opcode that 
			<br>selects the add operation and two memory locations.
			<br><br>The next step was to create a second-generation language which is later callend assembly language, which served to make the program much more readable and understandable
			and relieved the programmer from major errors in calculations.
			<br><br>The final step was to create a third-generation langauge or basically higher-level language, which was much easier to understand and to program with.
			<br><br>The first high-level language developed for a computer was John Mauchly's Short Code, it represents mathematical expressions in much understandable form, however the program
			had to be translated into machine code every time which made the process much slower than running the equivalent machine code. 
			<br><br>Alick Glennie then developed Autocode programing language, which used a compiler to automatically convert the landuage into machine code, which was basically developed for the
			Mark I (one of the early computers) at the universty of Manchester and was considered to be the first compiled high-level language.</p>
