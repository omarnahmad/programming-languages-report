			<h3>- High-level Languages -</h3>
			<p style="color:#696969"> A high-level language(HLL) is a programming language that enables a programmer to write programs that are understandable and 
			less complicated, they are considered high-level because they are closer to human languages and far from machine languages.
			<br><br>The main advantage of high-level languages is that they are easier to red, write and maintain. Programs written in HLL must be translated into machine
			language by a compiler or interpreter. 
			<br><br> The first high-level programming language was thr "Short Code" that's designed in 1950s. Now there are dozens of differen languages for example: C, C++, FORTRAN, Java, python, etc.
